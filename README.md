Microservice Performance Comparison: EF Core vs Dapper
Overview
This project is part of a Master's thesis conducted at [Your University]. The thesis explores the performance comparison between Entity Framework Core (EF Core) and Dapper in an advanced microservices environment. The focus is on evaluating the speed and efficiency of these two popular data access technologies within the context of a sophisticated microservices architecture.

Project Description
The project presents an API for an online show search engine, implemented as a microservice. This microservice is designed to handle the retrieval of show data efficiently. The choice of data access technology can significantly impact the overall performance of the microservice, and this project aims to analyze and compare the performance of EF Core and Dapper in this specific context.

Features
Microservice Architecture: The project embodies a microservices architecture to emphasize real-world applicability.
API for Show Search: The API provides endpoints for searching and retrieving information about TV shows.
EF Core and Dapper Implementations: The microservice is implemented using both EF Core and Dapper to allow for a direct performance comparison.
